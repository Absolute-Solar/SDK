Client library and examples for dApps to interact with the CryptoSun program library. Application development on the Solana blockchain. The Absolute Solar SDK is a Rust-based library that enables developers to seamlessly interact with the Absolute Solar ecosystem on the Solana blockchain. This SDK provides tools to manage the CryptoSun token (CSN), participate in staking, and engage with the decentralized infrastructure network (DePIN) that powers solar energy production, heating systems, and Bitcoin mining.

# Features
1.) CryptoSun Token Management: Transfer CSN, check balances, and interact with token accounts. <br>
2.) Staking: Lock CSN to earn rewards and contribute to network stability. <br>
3.) (Future) Governance: Participate in community-driven decision-making. <br>
4.) (Future) Energy Trading: Trade excess solar energy in a decentralized marketplace.

# Installation
To integrate the Absolute Solar SDK into your Rust project, add the following to your <br>
Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    absolute-solar-sdk = "0.1.0"

# Prerequisites

1.) Rust and Cargo: Install from rust-lang.org. <br>
2.) Solana CLI Tools: Install from solana.com for network interactions.

# Quick Start
Hereâ€™s a basic example of staking CryptoSun tokens using the SDK:

    use absolute_solar_sdk::{Client, Wallet};
    
    fn main() {
        // Initialize a client connected to Solana mainnet
        let client = Client::new("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");

    // Load a wallet from a secret key file
    let wallet = Wallet::from_secret_key("path/to/secret/key");

    // Define the amount of CSN to stake
    let amount = 10_000;

    // Stake the tokens
    match client.stake_crypto_sun(&wallet, amount) {
        Ok(()) => println!("Successfully staked {} CSN", amount),
        Err(e) => println!("Staking failed: {:?}", e),
     }
    }

For detailed API usage, see the API Documentation.

# Security
When using the SDK, prioritize security:

1.) Private Keys: Never hardcode or expose private keys. Use environment variables or secure key management systems. <br>
2.) Audits: The SDK and its smart contracts are audited by industry leaders (e.g., CyberScope, CertiK) to ensure robustness. <br>
3.) Bug Bounty: Report vulnerabilities to our bug bounty program for rewards.

# Documentation

1.) API Reference: Full documentation is available at docs.solarcrypto.ca (placeholder; update with actual link). <br>
2.) Whitepaper: Learn more about the Absolute Solar ecosystem in the CryptoSun Whitepaper.

# Contributing
